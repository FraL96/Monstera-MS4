Monstera is a project born from a passion. In the last year I discovered my big love for plants of every kind.
At the moment I share my house with over 50 plants, some bought and some grown from seeds (took from a shop or directly from the vegetables and fruit in my fridge). And almost every month the family grows a bit bigger.
I decided to create Monstera as an e-commerce shop, where users can bring home some of the most beautiful plants that exist, but also as a blog where to share with the visitors thought and tips about this beautiful green world.

# User Experience

## Project Goals

This project is being submitted as the forth and last Milestone Project in partial fulfillment of the Full Stack Developement Program at Code Institute.
The aim of this Milestone was to build a full-stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
The website had to use authentification mechanisms and provide paid access to the site's data, in this case for the purchase of products.

The main technologies to be used are [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [JS](https://www.javascript.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](), [Postgres](), and [Stripe]() + additional libraries.
