<h1 align="center">MONSTERA</h1>
<h2 align="center">the future is green</h2>

![intro](./add picture devices)

Monstera is a project born from a passion. In the last year I discovered my big love for plants of every kind.
At the moment I share my house with over 50 plants, some bought and some grown from seeds (took from a shop or directly from the vegetables and fruit in my fridge). And almost every month the family grows a bit bigger.
I decided to create Monstera as an e-commerce shop, where users can bring home some of the most beautiful plants that exist, but also as a blog where to share with the visitors thought and tips about this beautiful green world.

# User Experience

## Project Goals

This project is being submitted as the forth and last Milestone Project in partial fulfillment of the Full Stack Developement Program at Code Institute.
The aim of this Milestone was to build a full-stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
The website had to use authentification mechanisms and provide paid access to the site's data, in this case for the purchase of products.

The main technologies to be used are [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [JS](https://www.javascript.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](), [Postgres](), and [Stripe]() + additional libraries.

## Design

### Color Use

The website color scheme is consistent in the entire website and uses 3 colors, the green #5B9A3F, the grey #CAC8CF and the white #FFFFFF. The green is been chosen to match the main product of the website, plants. The grey is been used mainly for the text and to create a contrast with the green but maintaining an elegant style. And the white is been used to highlight other colors and give an elegant and modern look to the whole website.

![color palette](./image)

### Fonts

The font that I used for the whole website is Lora with a fallback of serif. The font is been taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I chose this this font because in my opinion it suits the website and the style really well. To distinguish between the different types of text (title, paragraph, button...) I used different styles of the same font, like normal, **bold** or *italic*.

![font](./image)

### Icons

The icons used in this website are all from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and are used to better communicate the action of a button or the content of a tab and generally beautify the website.

### Images

The images are all been taken from [Unsplash]() in order to be without copyright.
The shortcut icon instead is been taken from [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) and it represents a leaf of the Monstera Deliciosa plant.

### Defensive Design

To inprove the safety of the website and protect its users, some measures have been used to avoid the misuse of forms:

* Newsletter

* The login and register pages have been added whit the [Allauth]() library and it takes care that the requirements for the fields are respected.

* When registering, an email will be sent to the email address used for the registration and the user will have to verify its identity by clicking on the provided link before being able to login.

* When selecting 'logout', the website will ask again if the user really wants to logout.

* When checking out, some fields of the shipping details will be required.

* When checking out, the 'phone-number' field will accept just digits, while the 'full name' one, will accept just letters anad spaces.

* Defensive error pages have been also created for the codes 400, 403, 404 and 500.

### Navigation

The website is been created with the user in mind. The scope is to make it as userfriendly and as instuitive as possible.
Here below you can find the navigation scheme.

### Data Modelling

Tables to do

### Use of Database

In the developement phase the database used was sqlite3 (Django's default). On deployment instead, PostgreSQL is been used in Heroku.

### Wireframes

Here below you find the wireframes created to develop this website:

When the user will add product in its cart, the total amount under the cart will grow.
